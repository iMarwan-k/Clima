In this project, I learned the following:

    - Change the background and the color set based on dark or light mode
    - Working with TextField and setup the keyboard
    - Working with Delegate and Protocol = Interface in Java
        * Struct and class can adapted a protocol but class is the only one can inherited from other and the super class has to come first then the adopted protocol
    - Make a API request and handle the response data as JSON 
    - Closure
    - Extensions to classes, protocols, or data type is to extend the functionality to do something extra. For protocol, it gives a default functionality to protocol methods
    - Create code snippet
    - Get the phone location data using CoreLocation
